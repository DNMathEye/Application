            Career summary
        </h2>
        <p>
            I work self-employed as a maths and piano tutor, and write fiction in my spare time, but I have very much been enjoying studying programming and web development, and am looking forward to beginning a career using those skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have mostly studied Python, but I also started studying web development for this application and with a view on joining this programme. Once my time became more available, I found I was able to progress quite quickly, and am optimistic that joining the programme will also bear good fruit.
        </p>
